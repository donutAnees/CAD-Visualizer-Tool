# CAD Software Thread Safety Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive thread safety implementation for the GameEngineOpenGL CAD software. The implementation follows modern C++ concurrency best practices and is specifically designed for CAD applications where data integrity and performance are critical.

## Threading Architecture

### 1. Main UI Thread
- Handles Windows messages and user input
- Processes dialog boxes and property modifications
- Manages file operations and object creation
- Calls Model modification methods (write operations)

### 2. Rendering Thread
- Continuously renders the 3D scene using OpenGL
- Reads from Model data structures (read operations)
- Runs in `Controller::runThread()` method
- Uses read-only access patterns for optimal performance

## Locking Strategy

### Shared-Exclusive Locking Pattern
The implementation uses `std::shared_mutex` for the primary data structures, following the **readers-writer pattern**:

- **Multiple readers**: Rendering thread and other read operations can access data simultaneously
- **Exclusive writers**: Only one thread can modify data at a time
- **Reader-writer exclusion**: Readers are blocked during write operations and vice versa

### Lock Hierarchy and Deadlock Prevention

The locks are acquired in a specific order to prevent deadlocks:

1. **Level 1**: `Model::meshesMutex` (shared_mutex)
2. **Level 2**: `Model::acceleratorMutex` (shared_mutex)  
3. **Level 3**: `Model::cameraMutex` (mutex)
4. **Level 4**: `Model::projectionMutex` (mutex)
5. **Level 5**: `Controller::selectionMutex` (mutex)

## Key Components

### 1. Model Class Thread Safety

#### Primary Locks:
```cpp
mutable std::shared_mutex meshesMutex;      // Protects meshes vector
mutable std::shared_mutex acceleratorMutex; // Protects spatial accelerator
mutable std::mutex cameraMutex;             // Protects camera operations
mutable std::mutex projectionMutex;        // Protects projection matrix
```

#### Thread-Safe Methods:

**Read Operations (Shared Lock):**
- `draw()`: Renders meshes with shared access
- `getMeshCount()`: Returns number of meshes
- `getMeshProperties()`: Gets copy of mesh properties
- `findRayIntersection()`: Ray-mesh intersection testing

**Write Operations (Exclusive Lock):**
- `updateMeshProperties()`: Modifies individual mesh
- `updateMeshAllProperties()`: Comprehensive mesh updates
- `deleteMesh()`: Removes mesh from collection
- `createXXX()` methods: Add new meshes
- `buildAccelerator()`: Rebuilds spatial acceleration structure
- `selectMesh()`, `selectFace()`, `clearAllSelections()`, `toggleMeshBoundingBox()`, `toggleMeshVertices()`: All selection and mesh state changes
